Albus 
Author: Chris Mbogo

Introduction
The Kenyan economy is tough. With unemployment rising, most young people are turning to the informal sector to earn a living.  With the rise of freelancing sites such as Upwork, Fiver, and even more local platforms like HustleSasa, more and more youth are embracing the gig economy. Even employed folk in Kenya are known to take up side hustles in the gig economy to supplement their income. 

Problem Statement
With the gig economy expanding in Kenya, one of the biggest problems informally employed people experience is planning their finances. Unlike employed citizens who can rely on consistent payments at a regular frequency, the cash flows of informal employees are very irregular. They come in different amounts on different days of the month, which poses a challenge when it comes to budgeting.

The Product 
Albus is a simple app that solves this problem by allowing freelancers to budget accurately. 
With its calendar view, freelancers can now visualize their cashflows by identifying when money comes in, and when it is expected to go out. Freelancers can now ‘see’ how much money they have and how much they owe on a day-to-day basis. 

Minimum Viable Product
The first version of the application must meet the following metrics:
1. Users can add expected bills (cash out) to certain days of the month
2. Users can remove expected bills (cash out) to certain days of the month

Technologies

To get started with this you will need:
1. Node Js
